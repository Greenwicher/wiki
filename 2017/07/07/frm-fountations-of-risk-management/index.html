<li>Disadvantages<ul>
<li>In Theory<ul>
<li>M&amp;M Theory: no need to hedge in perfectly competitive capital markets with no transaction costs or taxes</li>
<li>CAPM: firms should only be concerned with systematic risk (beta risk) instead of unsystematic risk (idiosyncratic risk) under perfect capital markets</li>
<li>Zero-sum game: derivatives pricing fully reflects all of its risk factors in perfect capital markets</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In practice<ul>
<li>cause management to lose focus on the core business</li>
<li>use a flawed hedging strategy</li>
<li>incur compliance costs</li>
<li>reveal operational information that a firm may otherwise prefer to keep private</li>
<li>may end up increasing the variability of the firm&#x2019;s earnings due to the difference between accounting earnings and cash flows</li>

<li>Advantages<ul>
<li>In practice<ul>
<li>the possibility of lowering its cost of capital</li>
<li>reduce the volatility and greater stability of earnings/cash flows</li>
<li>allow managment to control its financial performance to meet the requirements of the board of directors</li>
